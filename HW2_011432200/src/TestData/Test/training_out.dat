-1	I'm sad to say that I am not impressed with the performance of this cup. I have been using two of these cups pretty exclusively for over a week and they both leak. If they stay upright and never get thrown about they are great, however, little hands tend to drop or even throw down objects, and when that happens all bets are off. I have been wiping up milk and water off the floor, off hands, and off the table and I am pretty close to retiring these guys (or using them exclusively for water). Honestly, its a shame because these are super cute cups, a good design as far as drinking goes, and they are insulated.
-1	These bottles were a nice addition to the collection, before I noticed how poorly they were constructed. The "anti-colic" valve at the base may help to relieve the symptom (I never noticed since I have a jackpot baby that's never been colicy), but the base leaks. Out of 4 bottles, at least 2 will dribble when placed on a flat surface and a third is suspect. While this could be understandable after months of use, these're so new they still have some of the cling wrap on them.The odd shape may help with holding but also makes the bottles a little more difficult to clean, making it feel like you have to remove the valve at the base as well as at the head to get every part of the internal curves.Overall, not worth it. I got these as a set of backup bottles, and they're almost all going in the trash before a weeks use.Seeing as how I got two negative votes on the day I wrote this, please provide feedback as to why you do not find this review helpful, as I feel like this is fairly written to illustrate what I felt was a serious design flaw.
-1	When using cheapo unvented bottles, our daughter never seems to realize that she could get more milk faster if she'd break suction regularly to reduce the vacuum inside the bottle. Perhaps she will never be an engineer, as I had hoped. Anyway, I think the venting valves on these Latch bottles are great in principle. But the valve seems to require a fair bit of vacuum before it opens to let air in. Combined with the unusually broad shape of the nipple, this frequently causes the nipple to get sucked into an inverted position.In my mind the nipple is more to blame for this than the valve. You don't want the valve leaking liquid, so it needs some pre-tension holding it shut. The resulting vacuum is not enough to significantly interfere with milk flow, so that is acceptable. At least the valve serves some real function. The nipple shape, on the other hand, could easily be changed to a more conical form that would resist collapse, with little if any loss of comfort. Basically I feel the nipple on here is more a marketing thing to appear different from other brands than something that is actually improved in any significant way. And any "pumping" is very obviously marketing hype BS, if nipple inversion is CLEARLY indicating the presence of vacuum -- rather than pressure -- inside the bottle. I'm a little astonished by others saying their babies prefer this bottle or that; our baby will drink milk out of any bottle we give her... assuming the nipple is not inside-out.I had previously cut some slack and given this bottle a 3 star rating, but in talking to my wife again she says she REALLY dislikes this bottle and won't be using them anymore due to the nipple collapsing issue. For that reason, combined with totally unreasonable cost, I reduce my rating to 1 star.
-1	Im a man and I can hardly tighten the straps.  My wife cannot pull the strap to tighten the straps.  The plastic clip across the chest does not snap well and this is only 3 months old
-1	If you own this product, the motor WILL fail.... not a matter of if.... when.  Lasted 4 months.... died on a night that my wife and I were completely exhausted and left us with even more lower back pain.This is not a product that you should leave your kid in but for us, it was great at rocking him to sleep so we could more easily transfer him to the crib from time to time.
-1	I really liked this monitor at first, but the second night of use I decided to unplug and bring the receiver over to my nightstand.  The night before I left it plugged in across the room on my dresser.  With our old Angelcare, the battery always lasted through the night (8 hours or less) but the VTech monitor was off when I woke up.  WTH?  Turned it back on and saw the low battery.  Nice.  Good thing my child is a sound-sleeping toddler who rarely wakes, and not an infant in need of several feedings in the night.  I will go back to my Angelcare.We tried it the next day during nap time, and the battery started to die (after a full charge) in under 3 hours.Original Review:We were using an Angelcare basic sound monitor, nothing special, before getting this.  The Angelcare's audio is still working after 2 years, but the display is no longer functioning.  We switched to this a few nights ago and I like it better.*The sound quality is good.  We use a noise machine in our son's room and the Angelcare always sounded very echo-ey.  With this VTech, the noise machine sounds like it's sitting on our dresser.  I can clearly hear my son if he makes any noise in the room.*The video display is good for this price point, but still mediocre.  The angle is not wide enough and takes some careful positioning.  I have nothing to compare it to, but I would imagine if you spent more on it you'd get better video. You can definitely tell what you're looking at, but it reminds me a bit of looking at an ultrasound picture when the room is dark.  You can make out his head and see him moving.  I don't know what I expected.  In any case, this is not a feature I require, so any video is nice to have.  I'm not sure how useful this would be with an infant.  My son is 2.  It is nice to see if he's in there standing up if he makes a sound, or if maybe he's just dreaming.*Very easy to hook up.  I made no adjustments to it and just turned it on.  It was dead out of the box and needed a charge, but we have not lost reception anywhere in our 1900 sq, foot house.  Our Angelcare had a cradle charger, and I do miss that, but the simple A/C plug works fine, too.*Talk back feature is nice.  Haven't used it yet, but I like having the option.  Especially for when my son jumps to his big boy bed.  Again, not sure if this would be useful for an infant.I have this sitting on a dresser, so I have not tried a wall or ceiling mount, but I would imagine you'd get better visuals if you did that.  As it is, I can see my son through the crib bars, but it's not the best line of sight.Overall, I think this is a great and inexpensive video monitor, and I think it's more than adequate for most people's needs.
-1	Apparently you get what you pay for.  I've used Philips audio monitors for our last three kids, but it can be a pain to move your in place solution when you just want to visit a friend or relatives... drop a cheap audio monitor in your bag and go.  Well..  that would really be great if the units would connect consistently.  The whole point of the technology is to use it through walls in normal buildings.  If you have to have line of sight to the device for the radio to be able to maintain connection reliably, well the unit is unnecessary then.I'll deal with taking my more expensive quality units with me - because getting a cheap one certainly doesn't give me confidence with the static and loss of connection experienced with these.
-1	The old saying holds true with this product -- "you get what you pay for".  While, I like the, LED lights which signal noise in your baby's room, I am not comfortable using this digital monitor with a small infant during the night. Battery life isn't great for this product. It doesn't live up to the "static-free" claim either. And, while the volume control function seems to work okay, but the product overall makes me a bit nervous.Best use might be as more of an intercom with an older child.I'd recommend paying a bit more and getting one with higher review ratings - Overall a disappointing product.
-1	We did a great deal of research before purchasing this item, and loved the small size and seemingly unique features.  The main issue with this "swing" is that it is too SLOW!  Babies like small, fast movements, and even on the highest setting, this swing is very slow. It seems like a baby would like the gentle and smooth movements, but our baby didn't love it. Also the different "settings" all seem too similar.  It does not vibrate either, which, for the price, I thought would've been a nice feature. We didn't have another swing to compare it to, so we just used it anyway, but ended up mainly rocking her in the glider and doing the 5 S's as Harvey Karp suggests (he's a genius, by the way).  I would just get a traditional swing next time....if this item would lower the price by about $100 it may be worth getting and trying, but definitely not at the current selling price.  I like how it plugs in and is small, that's about it.  Keep looking...
-1	I ordered these after having great success with two other packages of liners and discovering how much I really like the Bestbottom line! Only problem is this pack is pilling and shedding like crazy and it gets all over everything! I really appreciate the ease of use with these covers and liners. They have a trim fit and good absorbancy but this must be a bad batch. I plan to return and re-order and hope for a better liner.
+1	This book is such a life saver.  It has been so helpful to be able to go back to track trends, answer pediatrician questions, or communicate with each other when you are up at different times of the night with a newborn.  I think it is one of those things that everyone should be required to have before they leave the hospital.  We went through all the pages of the newborn version, then moved to the infant version, and will finish up the second infant book (third total) right as our baby turns 1.  See other things that are must haves for baby at [...]
+1	I bought this a few times for my older son and have bought it again for my newborn. This is super easy to use and helps me keep track of his daily routine. When he started going to the sitter when I went back to work, it helped me know how his day went to better prepare me for how the evening would most likely go. When he was sick, it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated. The note sections to the side and bottom are useful too because his sitter writes in small notes about whether or not he liked his lunch or if the playtime included going for a walk, etc.Excellent for moms who are wanting to keep track of their kids daily routine even though they are at work. Excellent for dads to keep track as my husband can quickly forget what time he fed our son. LOL
+1	This is great for basics, but I wish the space to write things in was bigger. A lot times I need struggle trying to read what the caretaker wrote in because the spaces go together.
+1	This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.
+1	During your postpartum stay at the hospital the nurses will ask you to keep a log of your baby's feedings, urination and bowel movements. However, when you get home you do not have a nurse to remind you or ask when your baby's last bowel movement was and you are so overwhelmed with the new schedule you can't even remember what day it is. The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in. The feeding column we wrote how many ounces of breast milk or formula we gave and how long he breast fed for. In the comments column we use it for tracking how much water I drink because I was not drinking enough to make an adequate supply of breastmilk. For a while I wasn't sure what was giving him horrible gas, so I started to track what I ate in case it was a food allergy (we have a peanut allergy in the family). We even write notes about his first smile, who came to visit, ect to keep in his memory box.
+1	This book is a great way for keeping track of daily changing and feedings.  My only wish is that it was in a 24 hour format.  But other than that it is great.
+1	Easy to use, simple! I got this when my baby was 2 months old and love it. It makes it easy to track things and write down developmental notes in an organized way. I know moms who create spreadsheets of their baby's nap times, etc. But I'm not one of those people! This book is practical and great!
+1	This item was extremely helpful, especially with 3 adults sharing baby care responsibilities. My husband of mom didn't have to wake me up to ask when the baby had eaten or been changed. It helped me keep a written record to take to Dr appts so I had all the information they ask you for on hand already, and even helped me note and analyze baby's sleep patterns once he got a little older. Definitely a useful item to have.
+1	Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!
+1	I didn't think I would really use this and I was wrong.In the hospital they were constantly asking &#34;when was her last diaper?&#34;, &#34;when did she eat and for how long?&#34; - ummmm I was on pain killers for a c-section and a mass of hormones. I finally got this out and started keeping track using this.Yes, you could just use regular paper, but I liked the layout of the pages and it was just what we needed a we slowly lst our minds for the first 6 weeks.I an on giving this as a shower gift to the next first time mom :)
