My 16 month old did not like these one bit as bottle transition cups.  There's no way to adjust the liquid flow, and because the rim is so wide, it's hard for her to make a seal around the opening to forcefully suck the fluid through.  Poorly designed.  We ended up giving them to a neighbor who is also attempting to wean her little one off the bottle, and she reported a similar experience.  It's too bad because the cups themselves were solidly crafted, grippy, and fun.
Grobag Carnival Baby Sleeping Bag, 2.5 TOG, 6-18 moI was thrilled to receive this Grobag for my grandchild, having read countless positive reviews and noting the oodles of nursery product awards it has received. Thus, I was astounded when I found our Grobag is constructed of what can be described as very poor quality, low thread count sheets. The material is so course it's close to not even resembling cotton; I wouldn't dream of putting it near delicate baby skin. Also, the batting is 100% polyester, which in my opinion is not a breathable or comfortable substance to sleep between. The bag can be opened from behind through a Velcro opening, and we are left with a very rigid, almost sharp tab enclosure on the inside where baby's legs would lay.I washed our Grobag a couple times hoping it would soften up so we could give it a try.  Regrettably, that didn't happen, thus I can't speak for its functionality. Perhaps there has been a distinct shift from its original quality (all of those wonderful reviews!), but I would not recommend anyone purchase this generation of Grobag for their precious little one.
As parents of two little ones, I'd like to say we are experts in appreciating different baby bottle designs and what works best for baby.  Here's our criteria for a baby bottle and where the Munchkin fails to win us over:Our Baby Bottle Criteria:====================First and foremost,BABY MUST LIKE IT!---------------------------------Munchkin Latch Bottle:Fails here because the nipple easily collapses.  Just a very slight pressure with your finger and the nipple collapses.  Now, imagine a moving baby with a slurping motion and this nipple collapses too easily.Avent Classic Bottle:We have a dozen of these from our firstborn.  Unfortunately, our son just won't take these.  We tried all of the nipple sizes from NB to level 3, he just won't take it.  We had learned long ago to just get 1 bottle of each type, because different babies like different bottles, no rhyme or reason.  Our daughter loved these.Avent Natural Flow bottle/nipple:He will actually finish a full bottle with this, but the bib and burp cloth will be drenched.  The wider/flat design means he just drools and drools.  Maybe good for others, but not for him.Dr. Brown:He was colic-y at first and this is the only bottle he would take without drooling.  He loves them, we the parents despise them because of the cleaning - 6 parts to clean.  But baby first and we endured this for 6-7 months until we discovered the Lansinoh mOmma *Natural Wave* bottles.Lansinoh mOmma *Natural Wave* bottle:I put asterisks around Natural Wave because Lansinoh has an older &#34;Lansinoh mOmma&#34; that is round in shape (and has orange coloring).  The Lansinoh mOmma natural wave bottles look like regular bottles and are purple in coloring.  So make sure you are reading about the right mOmma type!This is the only bottle in addition to the Dr. Brown that he would take.  No drooling (we don't even need a bib or burp cloth), he finishes everything and most of all, it is so easy to clean!  (just 4 parts more on that later)After baby approves, the next criteria is:HOW EASY IS IT TO CLEAN?==========================Munchkin Latch Bottle:This is pretty terrible, probably 1-star for cleaning along with Dr. Brown.  The nipple is an accordion design on the bottom that is supposed to allow for easy movement (and probably why it collapses so easy under suction).  Well, can you imagine trying to clean in between the grooves of an accordion?  What a pain.  Then, it has this blue-vent piece at the bottom of the bottle that you have to pop out and has small crevices that you can't really fit any bottle brush into, not even the Munchkin baby bottle brush set - hah!  Furthermore, having this &#34;hole&#34; at the bottom is terrible if you soak your bottles with water because you always have to have the blue-vent piece in there.Avent Classic:Probably a 2 for cleaning because it has 5 parts.  It has this blue ring that is annoying to clean.  We put up with it for 2 years until we switch our daughter to cow milk.Avent Natural Flow:Probably a 4 for cleaning because it has 4 parts.  The middle nipple-holder piece is designed just-so that it really tears up the sponges in your bottle brush.Dr. Brown:All parents despise cleaning them, yet baby-first and this is the bottle we used for 6-7 months until we discovered the new Lansinoh mOmma redesign.  If I could give negative stars for cleaning a Dr. Brown bottle I would.  All of the small intricate parts are a pain to clean, ask anyone, bleh.Lansinoh mOmma *Natural Wave* purple bottle:We love it, 5-stars for cleaning.  4 simple parts that is compatible with our bottle brush, nice wide design, easy to assemble, super easy to clean.OVERALL DESIGN THOUGHTS:===========================Munchkin Latch Bottle:Terrible.  The lid completely covers the middle-nipple-holder part.  This means after you have warmed up the bottle with hot water, you spin and spin the lid because there's no other surface to grab and it's slippery because it is wet.  If you have soapy hands and are trying to unscrew the top, it will spin and spin, too. All of the other bottles, the lid rests-on or at least is designed such that you can easily grip and separate the cap/lid.  Terrible to transport, must use a sealing disc, else it leaks.Avent Classic:Has a flat top.  Easy to put down the cap/lid and won't roll away while adding formula, etc.  Easy to grip, just don't like the extra &#34;ring&#34; that must be cleaned.  Used this for 2 years with our first one.  Smallest size is 4 ounces or 125 ML - this was too little and the 9 ounce was a big leap.  5 ounces would have been perfect for a long time. Easy to transport, no spills, nothing extra required.Avent Natural Flow:Same slippery lid issue as the Munchkin, but not as bad.  Rolls around the counter if you take the cap/lid off.  Smallest size is also 4 ounces/125 ml.  Easy to transport, no spills, nothing extra required.Dr. Brown:The bottle we the parents despised cleaning the most, but we used it for 6-7 months because it DID help with a colic-y baby.  Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.  Smallest size is 4 ounces /120 ml, but you CANNOT overfill, it will leak. We despise the 9-ounce version of Dr. Brown - too big for our bottle brush and bleh it actually makes cleaning worse if that was possible.  Another terrible design is that you have to take the cap off to install a sealing-disc if you transport this!  The last thing you want to do in a public place is have to take the cap off, etc exposing the milk to the elements.  If you put this in an insulated cooler and the bottle is not kept vertical and tips over, you'll have milk everywhere.Lansinoh mOmma Natural Wave (the purple one, not the orange one):The lid is great, it has a completely flat side that is easy to put down and won't roll around.  Our baby can drink an entire bottle with no bib or burp cloth.  The smallest size is 5 ounces which is perfect for our baby's needs. Easy to transport, no spills, nothing extra required.Given the reasons/criteria above, the Munchkin Latch is a 2 star bottle for us.
I have no idea why, but this tray that is supposed to fit all Inglesina Fast Chairs did not work with ours. It did not lie flat against the table but tipped up at the front (sloped towards the chair). I thought maybe the plastic was stiff and needed to &#34;relax&#34; a little, but it never did. I tried every which way to make it work and even communicated with the manufacturer, but no luck. Returned it.One thing I will note (assuming it had worked for us) is that the tray doesn't cover the gap between baby and table. It seems to be more about protecting your table than the floor under it. Our baby is small, so there is a fairly large gap between her and the table and she drops things through all the time.
Not a big fan of this car seat for a few reasons:1. it is bulky, but lots of car seats are so this didn't affect my rating, just thought it would be an fyi2. maybe we got a defective one, but one side is really difficult to click into the bottom latch, my son cries everytime I try because I'm putting so much pressure on him, I'm so afraid I'm going to pinch him with it.3. loosen the straps because of #2 you say? Well the other side, the strap decides it wants to loosen itself all the time, and it's not exactly easy to tighten them and then it would be even tighter on the side that it's hard to click in as it is! Just doesn't feel safe4. The fabric is SO heavy. I got my windows tinted in my car because we live in Florida and it obviously gets hot down here, and my car was always swelteringly hot. He would always be flushed and sweating in the back seat. The tinting has cooled down the car, but not him. He is still sweaty and red faced when I go to get him. The car is cool, but I think the fabric is just holding the heat and not pulling it away from him. I hate itWe've decided to return it and get something else
WTF. The pieces don't fit together, the instructions look nothing like the product, and when i finally got some of the pieces together, the thing couldn't sit flat on the floor because it's so bent.  Made in China piece of crap is going back.  FML
I've gone through a couple of video baby monitors so I have compared this one to the others that I have used.Pros:  Easy to turn the parent unit's display on and off (very useful when you are sleeping in a dark room and want the noise alerting function of the monitor to wake you up when necessary, but don't want a lit up screen on all the time).I don't plan on using the talkback feature with this unit, but it does work fine.Cons:Picture quality is pretty poor. It also seems to have a pretty tight camera angle; I have to set the camera further away than you would think to get the whole crib in the picture.The infrared nightvision is pretty weak compared to other monitors I have used.Camera mounting options are limited. You can either set it on something and tilt the camera up and down or screw it into the wall. Maybe it is just my nursery setup, but I've got a high shelf above the crib that I like to put the monitor camera on. Other monitors that I have had came with a clamp that I could use to mount the camera on the edge of the shelf to look down on the crib. This one does not. I'd rather not drill holes in my wall for a baby monitor and it doesn't tilt far enough down to set up on that shelf.The settings menu on the parent unit has no words, just pictures, so good luck figuring out what those mean.Overall, this monitor looks and feels a little cheap. I can't think of a reason I would recommend this monitor, since there are others such as the Uniden UBR223 at about the same price or just $10 more that I think would be better buys.
This monitor is cheap and doesn't work well. Over half the night it stayed out of range, which is strange, since my house isn't THAT big and other monitors have worked. Not a fan of this on AT ALL.
These monitors do not work at all, I even attempted to contact customer support to figure out if there was a resolvable issue but they will not get back to me. These monitors connected to each other easily but the connection is lost frequently even at close range and when sitting still! They will be on for a few minutes, then lose connection and have no sound, then back to working again. I would NOT recommend these monitors at all.
Short story, I was very disappointed with the quality and thought of the engineering on the product.  The best installation I could accomplish severely compromised the strap strength, but in a way that you may not notice or appreciate.  Save your time, check a different brand.Long story: I thoroughly researched the next carseats for our twin boys who are big-ish (90th percentiles) and just passing the rear-facing weight limits.  I compared this in-person to the prior model (Argos 70) based on Consumer Reports ratings.  This looked to be essentially the same.  Otherwise I may have gone for the Nautilus (for fear that the ratings wouldn't apply to this new model), but the Argos had slightly better crash ratings.  Let me say, it really is a nice looking seat, and the surfaces that come into contact with the toddlers are nice. I also really love the easily adjustable height. But...  I spent about 2 hours wrestling this thing around to try to get it to hold position in our seats.  I'm 6"4 and about 230lbs, so it should be pretty easy for me.  I've also had several seats now, so I'm familiar with different systems and mechanisms of installation.  And, I tried a number of different seat angles, clip placements, head restraint positions, etc.  Point being, I'm capable and was thorough.  For me, the fatal flaw was in the shell structure around the belt path.  I was using the LATCH belt, but the real problem was also present with a seatbelt install.  Namely, the path that the belt must take has it draping down over a plastic corner (so it bunches), some of which is 90degrees and rather sharp (e.g. it would cut a banana, or I assume a compromised belt strap in a crash).  Download the product manual, and you can see, on the page that has the warning that "Belts must lay flat," that the picture of the installation is not logically possible.  It has been altered with the LATCH attachments in the car shown angled (they are not), and a belt shape that on close inspection would lay in a squared U-shape to stay flat and negotiate the turns required by the routing guides.  I thought that this might be new to the new model, but I confirmed the same basic shape with the older Argos and with the Nautilus.  I didn't get out a ruler and measure, but it looked the same.  You can see that they have engineered a smooth belt path that exits directly out the back of the seat (i.e. it would run the belt parallel to the ground).  But, by definition, the belt needs to go back and DOWN at an angle.  Doing so brings it out of that smooth path and over a 90-degree section of the plastic shell (I'll see if I can upload a picture).This being my first time with this size carseat, I got a Britax model for comparison (our last seats were Marathons).  I immediately noticed the difference in engineering. It isn't even close.  The new Graco engineering/construction were similar to the 7-year old Britaxes (although they installed instantly and correctly in minutes).  The engineering and construction has come a LONG way since then.  I wish someone had simply told me that Graco seats weren't to be bothered with.  Furthermore, the biggest perk of the Graco (the design/style) is now offensive because it means they'll do R&D; but evidently only in the window dressing department (which admittedly, Britax could use a dose of).  Other issues: cheap single-belt (i.e. single point-of-failure) LATCH belt, cheap LATCH clips, no energy-absorbing tether,cheap shoulder belt pads, chest clip that somehow simultaneously is IMPOSSIBLE to open and can be opened instantly by a toddler, and worthless crotch belt pad which I think IS actually important.  Finally, for easy (i.e. cheaper) shipping, the seat folds back and forth (the first step of assembly in the manual).  By comparison, the Britax are static and have solid steel beams running basically l-shaped down the side (and have to ship in a big, expensive box).CHECKING FOR YOURSELF: PLEASE go look at some of these in a store.  Look at the belt paths, the clip quality, etc.  Tug on the crotch pad, feel shoulder pads, etc.  Check out the websites: one is all about "safety is when you have a pad next to your head" and the other is all about engineering and crash tests.  Also, I do think that some other brands looked more comparable to the Britax than the Graco, so please read this as more of an impeachment of Graco than an endorsement of Britax for anything other than comparison.
