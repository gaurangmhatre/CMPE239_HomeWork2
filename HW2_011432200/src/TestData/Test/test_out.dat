My 16 month old did not like these one bit as bottle transition cups.  There's no way to adjust the liquid flow, and because the rim is so wide, it's hard for her to make a seal around the opening to forcefully suck the fluid through.  Poorly designed.  We ended up giving them to a neighbor who is also attempting to wean her little one off the bottle, and she reported a similar experience.  It's too bad because the cups themselves were solidly crafted, grippy, and fun.
